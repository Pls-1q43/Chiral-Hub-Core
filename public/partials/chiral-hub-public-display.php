<!-- This is an example of a public-facing view file. -->
<!-- Chiral Hub Core primarily deals with backend, API, and redirection. -->
<!-- So, direct public output from this plugin might be minimal or non-existent -->
<!-- unless specific shortcodes or widgets are implemented for displaying Chiral Data. -->

<?php
// If you were to implement a shortcode, for example [chiral_hub_related_content source_url="some_url"],
// its output logic might render through a function that includes a partial like this,
// or directly generates HTML.

// For now, this file serves as a placeholder for any potential public-facing HTML
// that isn't part of a theme's template files (e.g., single-chiral_data.php).
